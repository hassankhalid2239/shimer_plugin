# Shimmer Effect App

## Overview
This app demonstrates the use of the **Shimmer** effect in Flutter, along with a **Fade Shimmer** transition. It provides a visual animation where UI elements shimmer as if light is moving across them. This is commonly used as a placeholder effect to indicate that content is loading.

## Features
- **Shimmer Effect**: A smooth, animated shimmer that gives the impression of content loading.
- **Fade Shimmer Effect**: A custom fade shimmer transition that enhances the visual experience while loading content.
- **Customizable Shimmer Settings**: Adjust speed, color, and duration to match the app's theme.

## Technologies
- **Flutter**: For frontend development.
- **Dart**: Programming language.
- **Shimmer Plugin**: For creating the shimmer effect in UI elements.
- **Fade Shimmer**: Custom fade transition for smoother user experience.
